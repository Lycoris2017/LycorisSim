Modification:
* 2019-04-11 @M. Wu

Target:
1. upgrade the G4 to the latest 10th generation
2. learn better the whole standalone G4 geo Dimitra made by reproducing result.
3. produce at most 1000 events in a dat format that Claus can work out a python lycoris processor.

Nomeclature:
* everything with "old_" is code from Dimitra, and new version modified by M. Wu;

----- Visualization:
* Usually you should do:
$ bin/tpcsim myvis.mac

* But it seems this will work:
$ bin/tpcsim

Then you open the vis.mac file with the gui, you will be able to see the geometry display.

----- How to setup:
$ source setup_code.sh

----- How to compile:
$ mkdir build/
$ cd build/
#$ cmake -C /cvmfs/ilc.desy.de/sw/x86_64_gcc49_sl6/v02-00-01/ILCSoft.cmake ..
$ cmake ..
$ make install -j8

----- How to run:
$ ./bin/tpcsim Beam_source.mac

----------- Instructions from Dimitra: -----------

How to setup the package

In bash shell do:

source setupILCsoft.sh
source geant4init.sh


To compile, do: 

make


To run (without graphics) do:

./bin/Linux-g++/tpcsim Beam_source.mac

-->This will give a roon output.
To analyse that file, run one of the .C macros.


## More info:
Different .mac files present for different kinds of beams.

Model code is available is src directory
eg definition of silicon layers in DetectorConstruction.cc
