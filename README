How to setup the package

In bash shell do:

source setupILCsoft.sh
source geant4init.sh


To compile, do: 

make


To run (without graphics) do:

./bin/Linux-g++/tpcsim Beam_source.mac

-->This will give a roon output.
To analyse that file, run one of the .C macros.


## More info:
Different .mac files present for different kinds of beams.
